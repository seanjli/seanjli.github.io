		<h1>Teaching</h1>

		<h2>Youth EUCLID Association</h2>

		<p>I teach for our two top Math Practice programs, more specifically our Math Practice 4.0 class (to prepare for advanced AMC 10/12 concepts) and our Math PRactice 5.0 class (an introduction to national and international olympiads).</p>

		<p><a href="https://youtheuclid.org">Our website can be found here.</a></p>

		<h2>STEM Academy</h2>

		<p>I mentor students and serve as a teacher aide in the Math Olympiad 4.0 series, which serves as preparation for AIME and early USA Junior Math Olympiad problems.</p>

		<h2>Problem Writing</h2>

		<p>This is probably more of a hobby, but I also have written problems for many mock contests in the past few years. Most prominently, I have written for the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h1747367">Christmas Math Competitions</a> on the Art of Problem Solving website, as well as for the nationwide NEMO math contest (I also serve here as a logistics manager).</p>

		<p>Here are some of my favorites:</p>
