		<h1>Teaching</h1>

		<h2>Youth EUCLID Association</h2>

		I teach for our two top Math Practice programs, more specifically our Math Practice 4.0 class (to prepare for advanced AMC 10/12 concepts) and our Math PRactice 5.0 class (an introduction to national and international olympiads).

		<a href="https://youtheuclid.org">Our website can be found here.</a>

		<h2>STEM Academy</h2>

		I mentor students and serve as a teacher aide in the Math Olympiad 4.0 series, which serves as preparation for AIME and early USA Junior Math Olympiad problems.

		<h2>Problem Writing</h2>

		This is probably more of a hobby, but I also have written problems for many mock contests in the past few years. Most prominently, I have written for the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h1747367">Christmas Math Competitions</a> on the Art of Problem Solving website, as well as for the nationwide NEMO math contest (I also serve here as a logistics manager).

		Here are some of my favorites:

		TODO.

		<h2>Sample Materials</h2>

		<a href="#">States and Recursion (WIP)</a>: Provides an introduction to solving problems via recursion probabilistically and in terms of expected value.

		<a href="#">Roots of a Polynomial</a>: Serves as a comprehensive overview to calculate symmetric expressions regarding a polynomial, as well as insight into its structure.

		<a href="#">Sample Exam</a>: Sample exam (with solutions) from Math Practice 5.0 program.
