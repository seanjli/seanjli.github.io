		<h2>Problem Writing</h2>

		<p>I have written problems for many mock contests in the past few years. Most prominently, I have written for the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h1747367">Christmas Math Competitions</a> on the Art of Problem Solving website, as well as for the nationwide NEMO math contest (I also serve here as a logistics manager).</p>

		<p>Here are some of my favorites:</p>

		<p>TODO.</p>

		<h2>Other Endeavors</h2>

		<p>I'm working to try new things in the STEM fields. More specifically, I'm working to compete in physics competitions (such as <a href="https://www.aapt.org/physicsteam/2018/">USAPhO</a>) and computing olympiads (such as <a href="usaco.org">USACO</a>) in the future. Stay tuned! ;)</p>

		<h2>Activities</h2>

		<p>I play a bit of piano in my free time, and am a second-degree black belt. I love watching movies and shows such as <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/70264888">Black Mirror</a>. I also really like popcorn and anything potato.</p>
